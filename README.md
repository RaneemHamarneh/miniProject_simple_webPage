## Toggle Display & Text Change Project

This is a simple JavaScript project that demonstrates how to:

1. Show and hide a `div` element dynamically.  
2. Change the text content of a paragraph when a button is clicked.  

The project is split into two files:  
- **HTML** file (contains the structure and buttons).  
- **JavaScript** file (contains the functionality).
